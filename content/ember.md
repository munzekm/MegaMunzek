Here are some of my projects in the field of computer science that I have worked
on.

[Cogitate Tool](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool) This is a open
source tool where you can manage the level of contributions within a group. Cogitate
tool will generate a score for the user based on:
Number of lines added or deleted
Pull Requests
Issue Trackers
Teamwork Performance

[MagaKath](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-100-S2019/project-cs100s2019-megakath)
Here is a store called MegaKath. I made this with a friend that was in computer science
100 with me. This was a group project where you could make anything you want.
We decided to create a store. Our store sold pencils, pens, Apples, Bananas, Blue Shirt,
and a Red Shirt.

[Ember is a powerful Javascript Framework that is designed to maximise developer productivity](https://emberjs.com/). Ember also has one of the best plugin experiences in the industry, which means you can get a whole lot of functionality with just a simple `npm install`. If you want to check out the power of [Ember's addon ecosystem](https://emberobserver.com/) you can visit [Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/) which is made by [Code All Day](http://www.codeallday.com/).

The design of empress-blog is a direct result of the work done to upgrade the [Ember Guides into an Ember application](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app). This system is specifically designed to make it easy for you to get started and if you have followed the [instructions on the README](https://github.com/empress/empress-blog) you will know exactly how easy it is. If you are familiar with Ember you are probably used to the Zero Config experience of setting up new applications and adding addons ðŸŽ‰
