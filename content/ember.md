Here are some of my projects in the field of computer science that I have worked
on.

[Cogitate Tool](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool) This is a open
source tool where you can manage the level of constructions within a group. Cogitate
tool will generate a score for the user based on:
Number of lines added or deleted
Pull Requests
Issue Trackers
Teamwork Performance

[MagaKath](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-100-S2019/project-cs100s2019-megakath)
Here is a store called MegaKath. I made this with a friend that was in computer science
100 with me. This was a group project where you could make anything you want.
We decided to create a store. Our store sold pencils, pens, Apples, Bananas, Blue Shirt,
and a Red Shirt.

Relevant Courses in Computer Science that I have taken:
- Computational Expression: Cmpsci100 (Java)
- Data Abstraction: Cmpsci101 (Java)
- Discrete Structures: Cmpsci102 (Python)
- Software Engineering: Cmpsci203 (Python)
- Computer Organization: Cmpsci200 (C)
- Web Development: Cmpsci302 (HTML/CSS)
- Software Innovation I: Cmpsci 480
