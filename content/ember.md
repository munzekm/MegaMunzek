I chose the major, computer science because it was so different than anything I
have done before. Coming into college I had no idea what field I wanted to go
into. I took many different classes like psychology, philosophy, economics,
environmental science, and I never felt a connection with any of those classes.
Computer science is so interesting and there are so many different routes you
can take.

## Here are my projects that I have worked on in Computer Science.

[Cogitate Tool](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool) This is a open
source tool where you can manage the level of constructions within a group. Cogitate
tool will generate a score for the user based on:
Number of lines added or deleted
Pull Requests
Issue Trackers
Teamwork Performance

[MagaKath](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-100-S2019/project-cs100s2019-megakath)
Here is a store called MegaKath. I made this with a friend that was in computer science
100 with me. This was a group project where you could make anything you want.
We decided to create a store. Our store sold pencils, pens, Apples, Bananas, Blue Shirt,
and a Red Shirt.

Making it with mega is my web development project. This website is a cooking blog
where it shares recipes and many delicious snacks.
