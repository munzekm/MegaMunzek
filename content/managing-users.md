Here are some of my projects in the field of computer science that I have worked
on.

[Cogitate Tool](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool) This is a open
source tool where you can manage the level of contributions within a group. Cogitate
tool will generate a score for the user based on:
Number of lines added or deleted
Pull Requests
Issue Trackers
Teamwork Performance

[MagaKath](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-100-S2019/project-cs100s2019-megakath)
Here is a store called MegaKath. I made this with a friend that was in computer science
100 with me. This was a group project where you could make anything you want.
Our store sold pencils, pens, Apples, Bananas, Blue Shirt, and a Red Shirt.

This is because it is entirely a static system. You can assign authors to posts and generate new ones using `ember generate author` but if you need full user permissions (outside of something like Github) and collaboration features I highly recommend that you sign up for a [hosted Ghost instance](https://ghost.org/).


It's a good idea to fill out the metadata on authors, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.
