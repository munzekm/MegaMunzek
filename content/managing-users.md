Here is where you can view my films that I have created within my video production
and film classes. The classes that I have taken are:

- Video Production 1:
This class is an introduction to film and video production. We learned about
camera, lighting, audio sounds, angles and how to be a director. It was a very
fun class because we got to work with the cameras and pretend that we were
a director of shows.

This film is about looking back into a picture and thinking about those times.
I had someone look back at a picture of a band then the band members came out and
started dancing like the good old times.

[Interview](https://youtu.be/OIwn-O33XmY)
This is a interview film about a friend of mine that is in the circus. She shares
details and her experience with the circus life.

[Chase Scene](https://youtu.be/ytG_AmXLw28)
This is a film about someone breaking into a house while the family is home.
The person that broke in is chased out of the house by the girl.


- Video Production 2:
This class was the next class after the introduction class. We learned more about
films and the way the camera reacts with different points in the films. We watched
a lot of videos to analyze and look deeper into the production side.

[Music Video](https://youtu.be/FBCJu4ZOZVI)
This is a Music Video to the song Oogum Boogum. It is about a group of friends
that get together and just let the music take them. Be stress free and just dance
and have a good time.

[Coronavirus and School](https://youtu.be/iEGE1yl4zeM)
This is a film about students that are adjusting to doing school at home.
There was a couple different students sharing their thoughts and feelings on how
they are dealing with coronavirus.

- Video Activism:
This class is about video activism. We are learning about the meaning of many
different things like protests, rights, and voting.

[Witness Project](https://youtu.be/1syqr7AjCoE)
Witness Project is about campus students that are going through a tough time
during Coronavirus. Megan Corletti is sharing with us how campus life has changed
and the struggles that she goes through on her day to day life at college.
