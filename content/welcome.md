Hello! Welcome to my page, where you can learn more about me and my interests :)

We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial **Getting Started** posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!


### There are a few things that you should know about me:

1. My name is Megan Munzek and I am a student at Allegheny college.

1. My major is Computer Science and my minor is Communications arts.

1. I am a technical assisant in the film and video production department here at
Allegheny.

### Quick Start

```bash
# if you don't have ember-cli installed already
npm install -g ember-cli

ember new super-blog
cd super-blog

ember install empress-blog empress-blog-casper-template
```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes üëç

If you want to see the blog system running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will
be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the blog in action.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [editing files with empress-blog](/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
