My story:
I was born in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. That is where I grew up and I continue
to live their with my family. When I was little I was always ready to do something,
whether it was playing outside, going for a walk, or hanging with my sister.
I got involved in swimming when I was 8 years old. I love doing sports because
I am such an active person. During my swimming years I also got involved
in gymnastics, dance, and volleyball. I continued my volleyball career until
I graduated high school in 2018.
I continued my education and swimming athletics at Allegheny College in Meadville
Pennsylvania. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Communication
Arts. I am a volunteer at ground for change a coffee shop on campus and I am
a Film and Video Technical Assistant.
In my free time I like to hang out with my friends on campus or go on bike rides.
