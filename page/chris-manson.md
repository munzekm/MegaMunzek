My story:
I was born in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. I went to school at Kiski Area High School
in Leechburg, Pennsylvania. I was very active when I was little. I got involved
in swimming when I was 8 years old. During my younger years I also got involved
in gymnastics, dance, and volleyball.
I continued my volleyball career until I graduated high school in 2018.
I continued my education and swimming athletics at Allegheny College in Meadville
Pennsylvania. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Communication
Arts.
I am a volunteer at grounds for change a coffee shop on campus and I am
a Film and Video Technical Assistant. I have also have currently accepted a
internship at PNC for the summer of 2021.
In my free time I like to hang out with my friends, go on bike rides, go hiking
or explore the outdoors.
